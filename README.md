Welcome to Alpha Labs.
This is a fictitious company I have used for a while to file and organize many of my projects and ideas under.
Over time I have come up with a whole story line and lore about the company and I might post more about it at some point.
Any similarities to existing entities are completely accidental. Please don't sue me, thx.
Anyway, with the legal stuff over with I can show you around.
Alpha Labs is divided into multiple "divisions" which are sections of the laboratory that specialize in certain things.
For example the Mechanical Division, ALMD, does things like engines, cars, robots, and even mechanical enciphering machines.
The Gamma Division, ALYD, on the other hand does more prototyping and millitary things, like ballistic calculators and fighter jets. They also do a lot of digital programs.
Feel free to look around the facility, but becareful some hallways harbor dangerous remnants of past horrors and bad mistakes.
